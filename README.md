# Hello and welcome to my Github Pages repository

Here are the projects it contains in reverse chronological order:

## Tip Calculator

[Tip Calculator](http://micael-w.github.io/tip-calculator/) is a calculator for calculating tips. It was made with classes as part of an introduction to OOP. I tried to make it as minimal and DRY as possible. The array bpt and the variables b, p and t are only named like that because it makes sense that the variables b, p and t gets pushed into the array bpt and I don't want line breaks everywhere. It's bad practice.

## Cute Animals Generator

[Cute Animals Generator](http://micael-w.github.io/cute-animals-generator/) is a version of a website that makes cards as you add them. This project uses custom made illustrations that, along with a color, is randomly assigned to each card. The images are also preloaded, since they're not immediately visible/loaded.

## Objects

[Objects](https://micael-w.github.io/objects/) is a group assignment where I was delegated to make the objects part of the website.

## Insurance Grid

[Insurance Grid](https://micael-w.github.io/insurance-grid/) is the first exam we made.

## Spiral

[Spiral](https://micael-w.github.io/spiral/) is some stuff I apparently made when we learned about css animations.

## Spotify

[Spotify](https://micael-w.github.io/spotify/) is a "clone" of the popular music streaming website using html and css.
