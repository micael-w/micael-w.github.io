# Hello and welcome

Here are the projects I have made, in reverse chronological order:

## Hime Hime CSS

[Hime Hime CSS](https://micael-w.github.io/himehimecss/) is a minimalistic CSS framework, a work in progress to say the least, but a framework nonetheless:3

It's also hosted here: [Hime Hime CSS](https://www.himehi.me/css/)

## Quiz

[Quiz](https://micael-w.github.io/quiz/) is an app that gets questions from an API, lets the user play the quiz game and then marvel at their results.

## Corona Tracker

[Corona Tracker](https://micael-w.github.io/corona-tracker/) is an app that gets corona related info from an API and displays it in various ways.

## Chuck Norris Ajax

[Chuck Norris Ajax](http://micael-w.github.io/chuck-norris-ajax/) is an app where you can push a button and it gets a "joke" from an API using AJAX.

## Tip Calculator

[Tip Calculator](http://micael-w.github.io/tip-calculator/) is a calculator for calculating tips. It was made with classes as part of an introduction to OOP. I tried to make it as minimal and DRY as possible. The array bpt and the variables b, p and t are only named like that because it makes sense that the variables b, p and t gets pushed into the array bpt and I don't want one million line breaks everywhere from calculations with long variable names.

## Cute Animals Generator

[Cute Animals Generator](http://micael-w.github.io/cute-animals-generator/) is a version of a website that makes cards as you add them. This project uses custom made illustrations that, along with a color, is randomly assigned to each card. The images are also preloaded, since they're not immediately visible, thus not immediately loaded.

## Objects

[Objects](https://micael-w.github.io/objects/) is a group assignment wherein making the objects part of the website was delegated to me.

## Insurance Grid

[Insurance Grid](https://micael-w.github.io/insurance-grid/) is the first exam we made.

## Spiral

[Spiral](https://micael-w.github.io/spiral/) is some stuff I apparently made when we learned about css animations.

## Spotify

[Spotify](https://micael-w.github.io/spotify/) is a "clone" of the popular music streaming website using html and css.
